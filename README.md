This code finds the orbit of Mars, using the genuis method Kepler used in the 15th Centrury.
The process was to take data in pairs of 687 days or a martian year. This is because Mars would be in the same place.
From Earth, observations for the angle between the direcion of the Sun and the diection of Mars were recorded.
Where the lines of Mars' direction intersect is where Mars must lie, as Mars must be in the same place.
If you had enough data you could plot many points along Mars' orbit and then be able to shape it out.

It is exactly this process that Kepler did and that I re-created with modern data.
I have 32 observation points and it was enough to get great accuracy on the paramaters that describe Mars' orbit.
I found very accurate values for Perihelion and Aphelion, as well as the semi major axis and eccentricy.

I used the python turtle module to visualize the process, and the code should run perfectly for anyone because the turtle libray comes with python.
